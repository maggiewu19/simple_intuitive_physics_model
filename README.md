# MIT 6.804 Final Project - Modeling Human Intuition for Object Collision
---------------------

This repository includes the simple simulation model used to infer human inuition for object collision as well as the game engine developed via pygame. 

**Simulation** is the major game engine - contains all levels and game environment. 

**Inference** is the file for inferring model result. No changes should be made here. 

In addition, we also plan to support a number of **Sensors** that provide real-time interactive features to **Models**


Project Setup
---------------
